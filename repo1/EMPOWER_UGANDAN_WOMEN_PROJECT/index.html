            <h2>Gender Equality</h2>
            <div class="box">
            <p>In Uganda, women face significant barriers to achieving financial independence, including limited access to
                 land, education, and capital.
                 This project seeks to eliminate these barriers and empower women to become active participants in Uganda’s economy.
                Gender equality in agriculture is vital for creating a sustainable and food-secure future. 
                Women are at the heart of farming, planting, harvesting, and managing crops-
                yet they often don’t have the same access to resources like land, credit, or education as men.
                 This gap holds them back from reaching their full potential.
                 By ensuring women have equal opportunities, such as access to training, technology, and a voice in decision-making,
                  we can unlock their full potential.
                  This not only improves their lives but strengthens communities, boosts agricultural productivity,
                   and helps fight the impacts of climate change.</p>
